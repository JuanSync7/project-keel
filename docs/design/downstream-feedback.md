summary: The bounded-convergence record for the defects bedrock-platform, the first real project generated from keel, reported back — a red gate on arrival, unknown directories the gate never sees, make targets whose effect nobody declares, and child processes that inherit every credential — plus the command that checks any keel-generated project for all of them. One slice per defect, five passes, each landed as one commit on a green `make verify`.

# Downstream feedback — what the first generated project found wrong with keel

bedrock-platform was generated from keel at `7f0a68b` and reported five defects.
Each was reproduced in keel before it was accepted. This document is the worklist:
the status table is authoritative, the per-slice notes record the measurement and
the decision.

## Status

| Slice | Defect | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | A generated project fails its own doc-freshness test on arrival | done — `make verify` green (776 passed); ADR-0010 proposed, awaiting acceptance |
| 2 | An unknown directory is invisible to the structure gate | planned |
| 3 | A make target's effect is declared nowhere, so a "check" can write | planned |
| 4 | Every child process inherits every credential in the environment | planned |
| 5 | No command checks an existing keel project for slices 1–4 | planned |

The cap is these five passes. A concern found mid-slice is queued at the end of
this document, not started.

## Ground rules

- Each slice lands as one commit, test-first, on a green `make verify`.
- A slice is not done until it holds downstream: it is exercised in a project
  generated from the working tree, not only in keel.
- No project fact is hardcoded in a check. A list a check consults lives in
  `config/` or is read from the document that owns it.
- Every writer a slice adds is declared to check_V and proven to reach its fixed
  point (`docs/guides/idempotency.md`).

## Slice 1 — freshness on arrival

**Measured.** Keel's 31 governed documents, committed once into a fresh
repository, are 31 of 31 stale under `tests/integration/test_doc_freshness.py`:
every `updated:` is a literal from keel's history, and the arrival commit is newer.

**Not only arrival.** The same failure recurs on every `copier update` that brings
a document in: the upstream stamp is older than the commit that lands it.

**Decision.** `updated:` means touched *in this repository*, so a document that
arrives from the template is touched on the day it arrives. A restamping doer sets
`updated:` to today on every governed document that is new or modified in the
working tree and leaves every other byte alone, so a second run is a no-op. Copier
runs it after copy and after update, and the project can run it by hand. The
freshness rule itself is not weakened.

**Built.** The writer is `scripts/jobs/restamp_docs.py` (`make restamp-docs`),
recorded in `docs/adr/0010-generation-needs-trust-to-stamp-docs.md`. Its cost is
that `copier copy` now needs `--trust`. A project generated from the working
tree measured 112 of 112 governed documents stale before the writer and 0 after.
The tests are `tests/unit/scripts/test_restamp_docs.py`,
`tests/integration/test_doc_restamp.py`, and the arrival and update cases in
`tests/integration/test_copier_generation.py` and
`tests/integration/test_copier_update.py`.

**Hardened.** A review found the copy task skipped two shapes: generating into a
repository with history (105 of 113 documents stale after the first commit) and
`copier update --conflict rej` (one `.rej` per document). The task now carries no
mode flag. The writer and the judge share one clock
(`review_docs.resolve_today`), the writer's target is never earlier than the last
commit, and both read changed paths with `git diff --relative`, so a project
below its repository's top is judged on its own documents. Each shape has a case
in the files above, and `tests/integration/test_copier_generator_contract.py`
holds every copier invocation of the writer to one argument list.

## Slice 2 — the directory taxonomy is closed

**Measured.** `check_B` labels only directories named in its own `TAXONOMY` list.
A `parked/` at the root and an unlabeled `src/zzz/` both pass with zero errors.
Of keel's 81 tracked directories, 45 carry no README.md/CLAUDE.md, so
`AGENT.md`'s "a new directory is not done until it has a README.md and CLAUDE.md"
has never been the rule the tree lives by.

**Decision.** An unknown top-level directory is an error unless the project
declares it. The rule for nested directories is stated precisely, gated as
stated, and `AGENT.md` is made to say what the gate holds.

## Slice 3 — every make target declares its effect

**Measured.** `scripts/run_make_target.py` validates a target's spelling, not its
effect, and says so. bedrock-platform added effect labels (its ADR-0010) and
labels `fmt` and `site-data` `[local]`, the same as `check`, so the gap it closed
for remote writes stays open for the tree.

**Decision.** Port the labels, the `$(WRITE_GUARD)` refusal under CI and Ralph
loops and the labelled `make help` as check_W, letter-compatible with
bedrock-platform's, and split the read-only targets from the ones that rewrite the
tree. The gate runner refuses a target whose label says it writes and fails a
read-only one that dirtied the tree.

## Slice 4 — child processes get an allowlisted environment

**Measured.** No subprocess in keel passes `env=`. The model adapter that spawns a
model CLI hands it every variable in the parent's environment, cloud credentials
included.

**Decision.** One helper builds a child environment from a configured allowlist; a
model adapter that needs a credential names the variable in its own config. A
check fails a subprocess call that does not use it.

## Slice 5 — audit an existing keel project

**Decision.** One command runs the template's current gates for slices 1–4 against
another project's tree, read-only, and reports what that project would fail after
`copier update` — so a project learns what it owes before it updates.

## Queued

Found during the slices and deliberately not started:

- **ADR numbers collide downstream.** Keel's ADR-0010 and bedrock-platform's own
  ADR-0010 share a number, so `copier update` would bring keel's in beside it.
  Template ADRs and project ADRs need separate number spaces; slice 3's ADR
  must not deepen the collision.
- **`review_docs` path forms in a nested repository.** Porcelain paths and
  `ls-files` paths can disagree when the project is below its repository's top.
- **`_SKIP_DIRS` and the `_git` helper are duplicated** between
  `review_docs.py` and `restamp_docs.py`.
- **`make new ALLOW_DIRTY=1` copies untracked files** from a dirty template,
  including a stray symlink at the root.
- **The copier 9.3.0 floor is unverified** for `_tasks` with `_copier_python`.
- **An untagged template skips `_migrations`**, including the update restamp.
