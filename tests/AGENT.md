# Agent rules — `tests/`

These rules are **local and authoritative** for this directory. They inherit from the root `AGENT.md` and `CONVENTIONS.md`; where they conflict, the more specific (this) file wins.

## Rules

- A new `src/<pkg>/<mod>.py` REQUIRES a mirrored `tests/unit/<pkg>/test_<mod>.py`.
- A new user-facing flow (route, page, or transport endpoint) gets a `tests/e2e/` scenario that drives it through the public surface — author it alongside the change, not later (CONVENTIONS §17).
- Do NOT mirror integration/e2e/smoke to source files — name them by the scenario under test.
- Unit tests touch no network/disk/process. If you need those, it's an integration test.
- Test through the package's public API (`__init__`), not its `_*` internals — tests are callers too.
